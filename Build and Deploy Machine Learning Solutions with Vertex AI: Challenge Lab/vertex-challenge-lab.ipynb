Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the quest to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on the Qwiklabs lab instructions page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.\n",

    "You were recently hired as a Machine Learning Engineer at a startup movie review website. Your manager has tasked you with building a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of user movie reviews as positive or negative. These predictions will be used as an input in downstream movie rating systems and to surface top supportive and critical reviews on the movie website application. The challenge: your business requirements are that you have just 6 weeks to productionize a model that achieves great than 75% accuracy to improve upon an existing bootstrapped solution. Furthermore, after doing some exploratory analysis in your startup's data warehouse, you found that you only have a small dataset of 50k text reviews to build a higher performing solution.\n",

    "To build and deploy a high performance machine learning model with limited data quickly, you will walk through training and deploying a custom TensorFlow BERT sentiment classifier for online predictions on Google Cloud's [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) platform.

You will then package your model code into a Docker container to train on Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Lastly, you will define and run a Kubeflow Pipeline on Vertex Pipelines that trains and deploys your model to a Vertex Endpoint that you will query for online predictions."

Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\\'s all this film has going for it.

His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.\"\n",
